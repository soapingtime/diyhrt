## Mirroring
I encourage you to start your own mirror, and open an issue or pull request if you would like it added to the readme. If you decide create a public mirror, it should be automatically updated by simply running `git pull` at least once a week (you can do this with a [simple cron job](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69553820)). Feel free to open an issue if you need any help.

This project is currently hosted on Github and mirrored at [git.disroot.org](https://git.disroot.org/diyhrt/mirrors), [git.gay](https://git.gay/hrt/pages) [(html version)](https://hrt.pages.gay/) and [hrt.wtf](https://hrt.wtf)
