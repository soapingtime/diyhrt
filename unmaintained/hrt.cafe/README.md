## FAQ

#### Why are you doing this?

I believe in creating and preserving important things on the internet. In addition, this website very well have saved lives, and is a great resource!

#### What is keeping this site up and going?

Github Pages is what this site primarily runs on. However, if for whatever reason it stops working, it will fallback to a server I have in my garage. The fallback is handled by Cloudflare.

#### Is this copyright infringement?

I am no lawyer, but if this is copyright infringement, I still have copies (C-42 29.24).

It is also unlikely this is copyright infringement, since phone books cannot be protected under copyright, it is unlikely a directory website is either. 

See Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 111 S.Ct. 1282 (1991).

If this is, in fact, protected, I am happy to apply for an exemption from the government.

Oh and if you live in Eritrea, Turkmenistan, San Marino, Marshall Islands, Somalia,  create an issue. I'd love for you to host a copy in case if this is actually copyright infringement.

However, if you are, or if you know the owner of the original site, let me know with one of the contact links below!

## Things I/We are working on right now
I am thinking of moving to MediaWiki while keeping the current look and feel of the site. I think it would make it easier to work with and easier to edit, and it would be editable by everyone.
