<h1 id="wiki_identity">Identity</h1>
<h2 id="wiki_am_i_trans.3F">Am I Trans?</h2>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>What does &quot;trans&quot; mean?</em></strong></p>
<p>*Trans is an umbrella term for individuals whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex they were assigned at birth. We use the term to include a wide range of identities including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, agender, and two-spirit.</p>
<p>For a guide to related terms, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_glossary" rel="nofollow">Glossary</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>I’m questioning my gender. How do I know if I’m trans?</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the most repeated pieces of advice is, “Only you can really know.” </p>
<p>But what if you don’t know? The best way to understand your feelings on gender and decide whether you want to transition is to examine your feelings from day to day. Keep a journal about how you feel about your gender, and talk to someone whom you trust. Talking to a therapist who is experienced in gender issues can be very helpful. If possible, experiment with your presentation—try dressing more masculine, binding, getting a haircut, and see how you feel. Give yourself plenty of time to figure this all out. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>When I was a child I didn’t do typical boy things or call myself a boy. Could I still be trans?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Many men, both cis and trans, were not overtly boyish as children. Some trans men claimed themselves to be boys when they were children, but many did not. We are informed by our parents and by society what is expected of us—to be girls—and it can be very difficult to start questioning that message.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>I don’t feel that much discomfort with living life as a female. Could I still be trans?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Some trans men live happily as female for many years before realizing they want to transition. </p>
<p>If you’re questioning whether or not you are trans, it helps to sit down and think deeply about why you’re questioning this. Maybe you’ve never been too uncomfortable living as a female, but when you start exploring, you find that you’d much rather live as a male. Reflecting on your feelings about gender is a great way to work through this question. You might find that you identify more with another identity under the trans umbrella such as genderqueer, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming, which is great too.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>I have little to no gender dysphoria. Could I still be trans?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Not everyone&#39;s is the same. Some people have very little of gender dysphoria or even no gender dysphoria. Some people will tell you that people with no gender dysphoria are not trans. Ignore those people. The definition of &quot;transgender&quot; is someone&#39;s whose gender identity is different than the one assigned to them at birth, not whether or not someone has gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>However, if you’re seeking medical treatment that requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, you should be aware of the diagnosis criteria for gender dysphoria. <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria" rel="nofollow">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V)</a> provides the diagnosis criteria for Gender Dysphoria in the United States. The criteria is different for adolescents and adults than it is for children.</p>
<p>Another resources to be aware of if you are seeking medical assistance in regards to transitioning or with assistance in regards to gender questioning is the <a href="https://www.wpath.org/about/mission-and-vision" rel="nofollow">World Profession Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).</a> WPATH provides the <a href="https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc" rel="nofollow">standards of care</a> which many medical institutions (including insurance companies) use in creating guidelines on providing medical treatment to transgender, transsexual, and gender nonconforming individuals. It provides in-depth guidelines on, not only treating gender dysphoria but also treating transgender, transsexual, and gender nonconforming individuals with respect, flexibility, and care. These guidelines can be used to advocate for yourself, and if necessary, educate your care providers.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>How can I “test” whether I want to transition?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are many non-permanent changes you can make to get a feel for presenting as male. While you’re doing these things, ask yourself how you like it and how it makes you feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try wearing masculine clothing. Go to a store and try on some pants and shirts that you like. (We’re lucky in that most people won’t bat an eye if a person they perceive as female is wearing traditionally masculine clothing.) If you want to, you can bring a friend. If you don’t want to go out in public, you might be able to try on a family member’s clothes or use an online retailer that allows you to try before buying or that allows simple returns. </p></li>
<li><p>Ask a trusted friend or family member to start referring to you with a male name and pronouns.  </p></li>
<li><p>Consider presenting yourself as male online if you aren’t able to confide in somebody in real life.</p></li>
<li><p>Try binding under your clothing and see how it feels. See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_binding" rel="nofollow">Binding</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try getting a more masculine haircut. Be sure to specifically ask the hairdresser for a masculine style cut, and not a pixie cut.</p></li>
<li><p>See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_passing_and_presentation" rel="nofollow">Passing and Presentation</a> for more on masculine presentation.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wiki_picking_a_name">Picking a Name</h2>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>How do I go about choosing a name?</em></strong></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/intenselotad" rel="nofollow">/u/intenselotad</a> for providing these resources.</p>
<p><strong>Making a Name List</strong></p>
<p>The first step to picking out your new name is getting together a list of possibilities. A common first place would be to ask your parents what they would&#39;ve named you, had you been AMAB. You can also talk to friends about names they think would fit you. However, when it really comes down to it, your name is very personal, and it needs to feel right to <em>you.</em> So, here are some websites you can use to find a name.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nymbler.com/" rel="nofollow">Nymblr</a>: Nymblr is a simple website that allows you to input &quot;inspiration&quot; names and get names similar to them as an output. You can then favorite names or block them from future searches.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/baby-name/advanced-name-finder" rel="nofollow">Name Finder</a>: This site allows you to set parameters for names, including first letters, last letters, popularity, nationality, and lots of other things. It&#39;s especially helpful if you have some sense of what you&#39;re looking for, but still want ideas.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/baby-name" rel="nofollow">Namipedia</a>: Input a name; receive the meaning, popularity, origin, and more.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.babycenter.com/baby-names" rel="nofollow">Name Finder 2</a>: Another name finder, sorts by gender and origin.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.babynamegenie.com/baby-name-generator/" rel="nofollow">Name Genie</a>: Input your last name &amp; gender and the genie will randomly generate a name. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.babycenter.com/babyNameYears.htm" rel="nofollow">Names by Year</a>: Find the most popular names from the year you were born.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.parents.com/baby-names/" rel="nofollow">Baby Name Search</a>: Allows multiple search options.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.seventhsanctum.com/generate.php?Genname=quickname" rel="nofollow">Quick Name Generator</a>: Generates random full names. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.20000-names.com/" rel="nofollow">20,000 Names</a>: What it says - lots of names organized into many categories. Thanks, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/TurtleTape" rel="nofollow">/u/TurtleTape</a>!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.behindthename.com/" rel="nofollow">Behind the Name</a>: A site with tons of resources, including name meanings and the capability to make lists. Thanks, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/2hoeaway" rel="nofollow">/u/2hoeaway</a>!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.babynamespedia.com/" rel="nofollow">Namespedia</a>: Names organized by category with meanings and related names. Thanks, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/davros_mueller" rel="nofollow">/u/davros_mueller</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/index.html" rel="nofollow">U.S. Social Security Administration&#39;s Popular Baby Names Page</a>: Has options to list popular names by year, decade, by state or U.S. territory, as well as view changes in popularity of names by year or by searching a specific name.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of organizing all these new-found names, my #1 recommendation would be a Google spreadsheet. List out names, origins, meanings, rankings, and anything else you find relevant. Then you can add friends and family to the spreadsheet and get their comments.</p>
<p><strong>Picking Out A Name</strong></p>
<p>Once you have a list, you need to work on narrowing it down. This involves getting feedback from others as well as seeing what names fit you personally. If you go with the spreadsheet option mentioned above, getting written feedback shouldn&#39;t be too hard. </p>
<p>Think about what the names mean to you. Do you associate the name with anyone else? Does its meaning resonate with you? Do a quick search for the name to make sure it doesn&#39;t have a really negative connotation in popular culture (like Joffrey, or something). </p>
<p>The last step before choosing a name is testing it out to see if it fits. Ask close friends to refer to you with a specific name. One of my favorite options is playing an RPG with your character using the name you want to test. Try talking to yourself in the mirror and introducing yourself with a chosen name. How does it feel? There is no exact moment when a name becomes &quot;right,&quot; you just have to try until you figure it out.</p>
<p>I hope this is able to help someone out there, and if anyone has anything to add, please let me know!</p>

<hr />
<p>“Passing” is usually used on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ftm" rel="nofollow">/r/ftm</a> to describe a person&#39;s ability to be perceived by others as a male. For those who want advice on their presentation for the purpose of passing or looking more masculine, we have assembled these resources and answers to common questions. For more in-depth advice, see <a href="http://www.t-vox.org/index.php?title=FTM_passing_tips" rel="nofollow">T-Vox FTM Passing Tips</a>, <a href="http://www.ftmpassingtips.com/passing.html" rel="nofollow">FTM Passing Tips by Andy and others</a>, and <a href="http://ftmguide.rassaku.net/" rel="nofollow">Gabriel&#39;s FTM guide</a>. </p>

<p><strong><em>Do I pass as male in these photos/videos/recordings?</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s difficult to judge from a limited scope of photos from a certain angle. While we can certainly give you some advice on whether you pass or how to pass better, you’ll get a better idea by going out in the real world. Go out in public and have interactions with strangers. If you can find a building where the men’s and women’s bathrooms are not side-by-side, go and ask somebody, “Where’s the bathroom?” and see what they say. If you have a webcam, chat websites like <a href="http://www.omegle.com/" rel="nofollow">Omegle</a> are a place to find out how your gender looks to strangers.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Is it possible to pass without taking testosterone?</em></strong></p>
<p>It is certainly possible to pass without taking testosterone. Some people who are not on T even live ‘stealth’ as males in their professional and social lives. Your particular face, voice, and body may make it easier or more difficult to pass without T. But you can work on passing by modifying your presentation and mannerisms, exercising, and even training your voice. The rest of this section contains advice on how to do this.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>How can I change my clothing to pass better?</em></strong></p>
<p>Dressing to pass is a unique challenge for every person, depending on body shape and style preferences. A universal piece of advice is to wear only male clothing. Within that wide range of options, some male clothing tends to work much better than others if you want to pass. You will likely need to go through some trial and error to find what works for you, but the following is our general advice.</p>
<p><strong>Top</strong>: Usually, the main concern when it comes to the top half of the body is hiding the breasts. This can be done by compressing them (binding), wearing clothing to distract from them, or a combination of both. Layering can disguise the curves of the chest. Try an open zippered hoody over a T-shirt (rather than just the T-shirt). You also want your clothing to not cling to you, because that can highlight the curves. Cling can be reduced by laundering clothes with starch, wearing woven rather than knit fabrics, and wearing looser sizes. Don’t go too baggy, though, because you can end up looking like a kid in their parent’s clothes and sometimes baggy clothes can accentuate curves instead of hiding them. Eye-catching patterns like stripes can distract the eye from the chest. Black is a good colour to hide the chest as well. If you’d like to do your own research on this, a good place to start is to find out how women with large breasts reduce the appearance of theirs.</p>
<p>Another common concern is creating the look of a masculine frame. Men’s bodies tend to have broad shoulders and muscular arms, creating a top-heavy silhouette like an upside-down triangle. This makes it important to wear shirts that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pt00uUI.jpg" rel="nofollow">fit in the shoulders</a>, even if it&#39;s just a t-shirt. Shirts that are not too long and are fitted in the torso, or at least not incredibly loose, also help (although this may be difficult to pull off if you’re also trying to hide your chest.) If you’re wearing a suit or blazer, a slight shoulder pad can help emphasize your shoulders. </p>
<p><strong>Bottom</strong>: Usually, the primary concern when it comes to pants is hiding the hips. Unless you are very muscular, you will probably not pass in women’s pants. Baggy pants tend to emphasize large hips and make the wearer look short and wide. A tapered leg usually works best to minimize the appearance of hips. Pant legs that are too long will either bunch up at the bottom, or you’ll fold them up, both of which look sloppy. If at all possible, tailor your pants to the correct length. If you’re on the small side, try boys’ sizes. Wearing youthful styles may help you pass as a young man or boy if your voice and face are not masculine enough to be seen as a grown man.</p>

<p><strong><em>My body is rather short and/or small. How can I dress my best?</em></strong></p>
<p>Being short and/or small-framed can be a barrier to passing as male, and especially to passing as your own age. And this is not only a trans guy problem. Take a look around--many cis men, even celebrities, are below average height. In fact, that&#39;s why it&#39;s called &quot;average&quot;—half of all men are below that height! There are numerous fashion and clothing resources available for short and small-bodied men:</p>

<p><strong><em>How can I change my hair to pass better?</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/menshair.htm" rel="nofollow">Have a look at some styles</a> and think about what might work with your face. It will likely take some trial and error to find a style you like, that also helps you look masculine.</p>
<p>Styles that usually work well if you&#39;re trying to pass:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sideburns cut <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sZUr6ny.jpg" rel="nofollow">straight across</a> rather than <a href="http://imgur.com/uTVE1xb" rel="nofollow">tapered</a></p></li>
<li><p>Hair with a bit of height at the top, to even out a round face</p></li>
<li><p>A short back and sides (#3 clipper or shorter) haircut is traditionally masculine</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following styles are not recommended as they tend to be read as feminine, especially on a soft face:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unnatural color dyed hair</p></li>
<li><p>Shaved or partially shaved head</p></li>
<li><p>All hair buzzed to the same length, especially with straight hair</p></li>
<li><p>Center-parted hair</p></li>
<li><p>Long hair, especially if it’s straight. It is possible to pass with long hair, but generally very difficult. Even cis men with long hair get mistaken for women.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you get a short haircut, be sure the hair cutter knows you are going for a masculine style.  If they think you are a female, there is a chance they’ll end up cutting it in a feminine style no matter what they say. You may want to be clear and say that you&#39;re trying to get a haircut that will help you to pass as male. If you prefer not to disclose, you can tell them you’re an actor playing a male in a play, so you need a male haircut.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><em>How can I change my mannerisms to pass better?</em></strong></p>
<p>Mannerisms—the way a person moves, gestures, and interacts with other people—play a significant role in whether a person is perceived as male or female. Sit in a coffee shop window or on a park bench and watch the way men and women move. There is certainly a difference, though not a universal one. If you’re interested, think about what specific mannerisms tend to be common in men or in women that you see. Keep in mind that there can be tremendous variation in different areas of the world, different cultures, and different social settings. For example, a man walking up to the ring for a boxing match does not walk the same as a man waiting in line at the post office. </p>
<p>If you want to examine how your mannerisms compare to other men around you, here are some guiding questions. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do men walk? Do they seem to lead with their shoulders, or with their hips? Look at the stance of the shoulders and elbows, and the placement of the feet. Check out this <a href="http://www.biomotionlab.ca/Demos/BMLwalker.html" rel="nofollow">walking demo applet.</a> How do men sit down? Do they keep their legs close together, or open? </p></li>
<li><p>How do men greet other men? Do they shake hands, or nod slightly? Is it the same when greeting women?</p></li>
<li><p>How do men convey emotion? When do they smile, laugh, or raise the tone of their voice?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there mannerisms that tend to read as gay or straight? Young or old? Serious or relaxed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your mannerisms are something you might have never given a second thought to in the past, and they can feel like a part of you. You are under no obligation to modify your mannerisms as part of your transition. But if you’re interested, for the purpose of passing or looking more masculine, give it a shot. </p>
<h2 id="wiki_voice">Voice</h2>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Is it possible to lower my voice without testosterone?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s possible. In order to make your voice sound more masculine while pre-T, you need to learn how to talk more from your chest, rather than your throat. Long-term practice speaking low can increase your lower range to some degree. Results may vary.</p>

<p><strong><em>What can I do with diet &amp; exercise to look more masculine?</em></strong></p>
<p>Being perceived as masculine has a lot to do with your body, especially muscle in your arms and shoulders. Targeted diet and exercise can certainly help you look more masculine. If you want to lose fat, be aware that there is no way to target fat loss to a specific area (hips, chest).

<hr />
<p><strong><em>What can pumping do to me?</em></strong></p>
<p>Pumping is the practice of using a manual or motorized pump to create a partial vacuum around the penis, engorging it as blood is drawn in. Some trans men are interested in pumping for these potential benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Temporary increase in size, for use in sex</p></li>
<li><p>Increased sensitivity</p></li>
<li><p>Permanent increase in size after a long-term pumping regimen</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There have yet to be any research studies that examine the long-term effectiveness of pumping in trans men. However, plenty of <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ftm" rel="nofollow">/r/ftm</a> community members have shared <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=pumping+OR+pump&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all" rel="nofollow">anecdotal experiences with pumping.</a></p>

<p><strong><em>What are the reproductive consequences of taking testosterone?</em></strong></p>
<p>Long-term use of testosterone usually shuts down the body’s natural reproductive axis. The ovaries stop producing estrogen and stop releasing eggs, halting menstruation. However, this is not guaranteed, and there have been trans men who became pregnant by accident while on testosterone (<a href="http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=7926533" rel="nofollow">1</a>). It is dangerous to continue a pregnancy while on testosterone because the fetus is exposed to the hormone.</p>
<p>If you stop taking testosterone, the reproductive system can begin to function again within several months (<a href="http://www.nickgorton.org/Medical%20Therapy%20and%20HM%20for%20Transgender%20Men_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">source</a>, p. 58). It is possible to stop taking testosterone for some time to have a pregnancy, and then resume testosterone. This is not a guaranteed option, though, because testosterone may cause permanent sterility (<a href="http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/care_program_and_services/hospital_services/Documents/hormones-FTM.pdf" rel="nofollow">source</a>, p. 10). </p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>What are the reproductive consequences of a hysterectomy?</em></strong></p>
<p>A hysterectomy, the removal of the uterus, means you will no longer be able to carry a pregnancy. Some people get a hysterectomy plus oophorectomy, the removal of the ovaries. In this case, you will no longer be able to have biological children. If you keep your ovaries, biological children are still possible by the process of oocyte harvest or banking. <a href="http://www.nickgorton.org/Medical%20Therapy%20and%20HM%20for%20Transgender%20Men_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">More</a> at p. 59.</p>

<p><strong><em>How much is my transition going to cost?</em></strong></p>
<p>The cost of transition varies with your location and what specific steps you want to take in your transition. For more information on transition where you live, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_country-specific_resources" rel="nofollow">Country-Specific Resources</a>.

<p><strong>Presentation</strong>
Acquiring a wardrobe of male clothing can be expensive, especially if your proportions are uncommon and you need things tailored. Shopping at local thrift stores can reduce this expense. This is especially wise if you are pre-T and are planning to gain a lot of muscle through working out. Don’t spend a lot of money on clothes that won’t fit you in the near future. </p>
<p>Some people have had success buying clothing from eBay, <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/activities/mens_fashion/index.html" rel="nofollow">AliExpress</a>, <a href="http://www.yesstyle.com/en/home.html" rel="nofollow">Yesstyle</a>, and other online retailers. Just make sure you have enough sizing information, because no matter how good the deal, it needs to fit you.</p>

<p>For a rough summary of the monthly cost of testosterone, see our chart in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_testosterone" rel="nofollow">Testosterone</a>. For as long as you are on testosterone, you will need regular blood work and visits to your prescribing doctor (usually every 6 months). Your private insurance or publicly funded healthcare may cover some of these expenses.</p>
<p>You may require additional health care and drugs to treat unwanted effects from testosterone such as acne and hair loss. Some people recommend taking vitamin supplements. Speak to your doctor about what supplements can do for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>USA: If you use a local pharmacy, check <a href="http://goodrx.com" rel="nofollow">GoodRx.com</a> for a coupon that may save you significant money on your testosterone prescription. </p></li>
<li><p>Canada: Doctor&#39;s visits and bloodwork ordered by your doctor are covered by public health insurance. Your drug cost may also be covered, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>UK: If you are with NHS, they cover the drug cost but residents of England must pay prescription charges. Another way to have your testosterone and bloodwork funded is to enter a Shared Care agreement with a private doctor. See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_united_kingdom" rel="nofollow">United Kingdom</a>.</p></li>

<p><strong>Surgery</strong>
Costs vary by surgeon and procedure. For information on publicly funded surgeries in certain countries, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_country-specific_resources" rel="nofollow">Country-Specific Resources</a>. </p>
<p>When calculating the cost of your surgery, be sure to consider peripheral expenses such as travel, medical supplies, time off work, scar treatment, and health care to address postoperative complications that may arise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Top surgery: Usually $5-10,000 USD.</p></li>
<li><p>Hysterectomy: $10-20,000 USD.</p></li>
<li><p>Bottom surgery: Highly dependent on procedure(s) and number of stages. Simple metoidioplasty without testicular implants is ~$5000 USD; testicular implants add another couple thousand. Metoidioplasty with urethroplasty and testicular implants is ~$20-30,000+ USD.  Multi-stage phalloplasty with urethroplasty, testicular implants, and erectile implant is ~$75-150,000 USD.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Legal changes</strong>
If you wish to change your legal name and gender, the process may involve fees. In some places, a gender change requires a letter from your doctor or surgeon, which you may be charged for. You may be required to pay to publish a notice of your name change in a local newspaper. Also, once you have the legal change you will want to update all your identification documents (e.g. passport) and these may require additional fees to update. If you’re planning to change both name and gender, you can save money by waiting to do both at the same time, so you only pay for one replacement passport. For info on legal costs where you live, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_country-specific_resources" rel="nofollow">Country-Specific Resources</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>What are some ways I can save more of my income to finance my transition?</em></strong></p>
<p>The first step is to create a budget outlining all your income and spending. By reducing how much you spend, you can put aside more money for transition each month. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance" rel="nofollow">/r/personalfinance</a> has an FAQ on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting" rel="nofollow">Budgeting</a> and the sub is an excellent resource for personal finance advice.</p>
<p>When you pay medical expenses out of pocket, you may be able to claim these expenses on your tax return. This may include peripheral costs such as travel to medical appointments. Do some research or ask a tax expert about medical deductions in your taxation region.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>What are some ways I can make extra income to finance my transition?</em></strong></p>
<p>If you can&#39;t take on a regular full-time or part-time job for some reason, there are still ways to supplement your income. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoney" rel="nofollow">/r/beermoney</a> is a community about online money-making opportunities. Don&#39;t expect to make a living from this, only some extra cash. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/mightybite" rel="nofollow">/u/mightybite</a> recommends <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/29nz8l/get_paid_1015_dollars_for_515_minutes_of_your/" rel="nofollow">Usertesting</a> for the high payouts for your time.</p>
<p>Some people run e-commerce stores on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" rel="nofollow">Etsy</a>, <a href="http://www.storenvy.com/" rel="nofollow">Storenvy</a>, or similar sites as supplemental income.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><em>Can I travel by plane with my binder, packer, or unchanged identity documents?</em></strong></p>
<p>If you have identity documents where the names or gender markers don&#39;t match up, this may give you trouble during travel. Have your doctor write a &quot;carry letter&quot; explaining that your IDs don&#39;t match because you are in the process of a gender transition. This can help to make travel smoother.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><em>What if I decide that transitioning is not for me?</em></strong></p>
<p>Check out this <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/features/2017/06/28/25252342/the-detransitioners-they-were-transgender-until-they-werent" rel="nofollow">article in The Stranger</a> detailing <em>some</em> individuals&#39; experiences with detransitioning.</p>
<p>If you decide that transitioning is not the right step for you, then it is important to speak to a therapist. You have many options, including a choice between detransition, retransition, or continuing transition.  If you have not had an oophorectomy, you may want to stop taking testosterone as soon as possible in order to halt the changes caused by T.  </p>
<p><strong><em>How can I know if detransition is the right choice for me?</em></strong></p>
<p>Speak with your therapist. If you don’t have access to a therapist, look to your local LGBT center for resources. Try to question why you’re thinking of detransitioning. Is it because the changes are happening too fast? Talk about receiving a lower dose. Is it because of the social implications? Talk to a therapist about anxiety issues and treatment. Is it because you don’t want to appear as male? Question why you wanted to transition in the first place. There is nothing wrong with questioning yourself, or with finding that other identities than male fit you.</p>
<p>Remember: If you stop taking testosterone and/or other steps to transition, but later decide that you want to take those steps again, the option will still be open. </p>

<p>After you stop taking testosterone, some of the effects of the hormone will reverse, but they won’t necessarily reverse completely. Some reversals will be immediate, while others can take months or years.</p>

<h1 id="wiki_prevalence_of_trans_people">Prevalence of Trans People</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>How many trans or FTM people are there?</em></strong></p>
<p>Trans people are incredibly diverse in their lifestyles, medical choices, and whether or not they are &#39;out&#39;. Thus, it is difficult to find a good estimate of the number of trans people in a population. If you wanted to know how many people graduated from Harvard in 2015, you could get the record from the University. But for trans people, there is no official record.</p>
<p>Early researchers estimated the incidence of transsexualism by counting how many people were approved for reassignment surgery. These numbers exclude those who cannot access these surgeries, and those who do not want them. Other studies estimate the number of trans people by name and gender marker changes in government databases. Again, some trans people are not able to make these changes, and some do not choose to.</p>
<p>Survey studies approach the question differently, asking a person to self-identify as trans rather than using medical or legal criteria. </p>
<p>The following table is a summary of some of the research concerning the incidence of trans people, or relative incidence of FTM and MTF spectrum people. Keep in mind that a study can only estimate, and that some methods produce more reliable estimates than others. <em>All</em> research on this question is subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias" rel="nofollow">sampling bias</a>.</p>

<h1 id="wiki_glossary">Glossary</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AFAB, CAFAB, DFAB, FAAB:</strong> These are abbreviations for Coercively Assigned Female At Birth, Designated Female At Birth, and Female-Assigned At Birth. These terms can be used in place of &quot;born a women&quot; to be more inclusive and validating of trans people. They emphasize that &quot;female&quot; is a designation assigned to an individual at birth, not an inherent quality of the individual.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Binary:</strong> In the context of transness, Binary refers to a binary gender, meaning Male or Female. This is the opposite of a nonbinary individual, whose gender lies outside the gender binary and is neither male nor female.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Binding:</strong> The process of applying a specific garment or tape (Trans Tape or Kinesiology Tape, never bandages!) to an AFAB individual&#39;s chest to give the appearance of a flat chest. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bottom Surgery:</strong> Referring to gender-affirming genital surgery to either create a phallus, remove birth genitals, or in the case of trans women, create a vagina. For trans men/mascs, there are two surgery techniques to create a phallus: Metoidioplasty and Phalloplasty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cisgender:</strong> This term describes individuals whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deadnaming:</strong> The act of referring to a trans person as their birth name when they no longer go by that name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detransition:</strong> When a person, trans or otherwise, has undergone some form of medical or social transition, and later has to stop or reverse the transition. This is often due to safety concerns, lack of access to medical care, repression, or on occasion, genuine regret. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dysphoria:</strong> Often described as a profound state of unease, dissatisfaction, or distress. When these feelings are associated with gender, either social or physical, it is called gender dysphoria. It can present in many different forms and levels, including, but not limited to: Dissociation, depersonalization, depression, irritability, anxiety, and repulsion. Gender dysphoria is listed as a condition in the DSM-5, and to obtain medical treatment for transition you may be required to meet their diagnostic criteria. See <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">DSM-5 Gender Dysphoria Fact Sheet</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Erectile Device:</strong> A device used to assist in erections post-phalloplasty. External devices are often sleeves or rings that allow rigidity to the phallus and can be removed. Internal devices are surgically implanted and require some manipulation. The two main types of implant are the Semi-Rigid Rod, which allows for a permanent rigidity that is malleable enough to adjust to a more neutral position (Think of how a pipe-cleaner is stiff enough to maintain shape, but can be bent upwards or downwards.) or the Inflatable Pump, which allows for assisted erections by manipulation of a pump within one of the testicles that pumps saline into a rod in the penis to allow it to inflate much like a natural erection would. You can find more information at <a href="https://www.phallo.net/how-penile-implants-work.htm" rel="nofollow">Phallo.net</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Euphoria:</strong> Seen as the opposite to Dysphoria, this can relate to feelings of joy, comfort, contentedness, pride, or a simple feeling of something being correct. This is often experienced when a trans person&#39;s gender is affirmed, through social or physical transition and being treated like their true gender.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FTM:</strong> Female to Male or Female to Masculine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FTN:</strong> Female to Nonbinary or Female to Null</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gender identity:</strong> This term refers to a person&#39;s own experience of their gender. A person may feel internally that they are male or female, masculine or feminine, something between the two, or something else.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genderqueer:</strong> A person who feels that their gender identity is not wholly male nor wholly female may identify as genderqueer. This broad term can include identities between male and female, identities comprising of multiple genders (e.g. bigender), identities without gender (agender, neutrois), and those with a gender identity that fluctuates (genderfluid). A person who is genderqueer may or may not choose to undertake hormone therapy or surgery as part of their transition. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gender-Nonconforming:</strong> Also known as GNC. This is when someone dresses, acts, or otherwise presents in a way that is different from their gender. This can include things like a man painting his nails, wearing makeup, having traditionally feminine body language, or doing things typically associated with women and femininity. Women can also be gender-nonconforming and dress, act, or present in male or masculine ways. In their case, their presentation does not match up with their gender, but it does not make them any less for presenting as such. Nor is it always an indication of someone&#39;s transness. Some terms used to describe someone who is gender-nonconforming include: Tomboy, Butch, Stud (Primarily used in the black lesbian community), Femboy, Tomgirl, Sissy (Primarily used in NSFW settings), or Effeminate. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genderfluid:</strong> A gender that does not stay at a constant identity and can fluxuate between multiple genders, such as male, female, nonbinary, or agender.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hormone Blockers:</strong> Also referred to as Puberty Blockers, this is a form of gender-affirming medical care which allows young trans people to prevent the potentially negative outcomes of going through a puberty that does not match their gender.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hormone Therapy:</strong> Also known as HRT (or TRT for trans men/mascs), this is the medical treatment many trans people undergo to masculinize or feminize the body. To read more about the effects of Masculinizing HRT, see <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22322-masculinizing-hormone-therapy" rel="nofollow">The Cleveland Clinic&#39;s guide to TRT</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intersex:</strong> Refers to someone born with an intersex condition. This is an umbrella term for many different umbrella terms, and can mean anything from mixed sex characteristics to atypical chromosonal makeup, and more. To learn more, see  <a href="https://interactadvocates.org/intersex-definitions/" rel="nofollow">InterAct&#39;s guide to intersex conditions</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metoidioplasty:</strong> Often shortened to &quot;Meta&quot;. This is a bottom surgery procedure in which the ligaments tethering the T-Dick are cut to release the erectile tissue and provide more length. With this method, spontaneous erections are achievable, but the size and placement may be detrimental to some. See R/Metoidioplasty for more info.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Misgender:</strong> The act of referring to someone with incorrect pronouns. Can include calling someone who uses he/him  &quot;She&quot;, using derogatory pronouns such as &quot;It&quot; to refer to a trans person, or using &quot;They/Them&quot; to refer to a person who does not use the pronouns They/Them (Also known as &quot;De-Gendering&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nonbinary:</strong> Also known as Non-Binary, NB*, or Enby. This includes anyone whose gender does not fit within the gender binary. 
*NB is also used within black communities to denote &quot;Non-Black&quot; </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Passing:</strong> On <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ftm" rel="nofollow">/r/ftm</a>, this term usually refers to a person&#39;s ability to be perceived by others as a male. Passing is not necessarily the goal of transition, but if you personally want to be perceived as a male or as more masculine, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_passing_and_presentation" rel="nofollow">Passing and Presentation</a> for advice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phalloplasty:</strong> A surgical procedure to create a phallus by use of graft skin from a donor site (Most common places are ALT: Thigh, or RFF: Forearm) to create a phallus. For more information, check out <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/phalloplasty" rel="nofollow">r/phalloplasty</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/everything_phallo" rel="nofollow">r/everything_phallo</a> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Questioning:</strong> A person who is questioning is someone who has yet to discover their gender and is in the process of figuring it out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scrotoplasty:</strong> A medical procedure in which a scrotal sac is created, often using the labia majora.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stealth:</strong> When a trans person is able to fully pass as their gender and live their life without telling anyone they are trans. To all who see them, they are indistinguishable from a cis person. A stealth person may omit or change details about their past or medical history to maintain their stealth position. This is not the same as deceiving people, or &quot;Stealthing&quot; which is the act of telling a sexual partner you are wearing a condom when you are not. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testicular Implants:</strong> After a scrotoplasty, testicular implant can be inserted into the scrotum to achieve a natural looking scrotum. The implants are filled with saline. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TERF:</strong> Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist. These are transphobic individuals who often have the incorrect opinion that trans women are &quot;Men in dresses&quot; and predators, while trans men are &quot;Confused victimized girls&quot; and brainwashed/traumatized/escaping misogyny. They are often vitrolic and dismissive of the trans experience and not tolerated on this subreddit.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trans:</strong> This is a broad term for individuals whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex they were assigned at birth. We use the term to include a wide range of identities including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, agender, and two-spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transgender:</strong> This term describes individuals whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex they were born into. This is sometimes used as an umbrella term that includes genderqueer and nonbinary people, crossdressers, drag queens, drag queens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transition:</strong> The process of physical, social, and legal changes that a person takes in order to align their life with their gender identity. Transition <em>can</em> include hormone therapy, surgery, changes in physical presentation, adopting a different name and pronouns, and legal name and gender change. These steps are undertaken by personal choice; they are not required, other steps could be taken, and they are not necessarily done in any order.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transmasc:</strong> Originally a nonbinary specific term to describe a direction of transition that avoided binary gender language, it has now expanded and has been adopted by some trans men. This is a perscriptive identity, not a descriptive identity, as some trans men feel uncomfortable with the term and its gender-neutral nature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transphobia:</strong> Bigotry against trans people. Transphobia that intersects with misandry is called &quot;Transandrophobia&quot;, while transphobia that intersects with misogyny is called &quot;Transmisogyny&quot;. The term Transmisogyny is most often used in reference to trans women, though trans men can also experience an intersection of transphobia and misogyny as AFABs. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transsexual:</strong> This term is usually used to refer to individuals whose gender identity does not match the sex that was assigned to them at birth, and seek hormonal and/or surgical treatment in order to bring their body into alignment with their gender identity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transsex:</strong> This term is a more modernized version of the term &quot;Transsexual&quot; and is often used by those who wish to reclaim the term and feel that it more accurately represents their experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Truscum/Tucute:</strong> Terms originated due to tumblr discourse in the 2010&#39;s. The terms were created by cis people pretending to be trans, but were later adopted by trans people. Truscum ideology revolves around gatekeeping dysphoria and can sometimes lead to denial of nonbinary people. Tucute ideology revolves around unquestioning acceptance of everything, including harmful terms such as &quot;Transracial&quot; &quot;Transabled&quot; and &quot;Transhuman&quot;.  Most trans people do not fall into either group and it is not recommended to seek out or join either, as the two communities are prone to toxicity and internalized transphobia. <strong>Both of these terms and discussion of them are banned on the subreddit to avoid unnecessary drama</strong></p></li>

<p><strong>What do all these user flairs mean?</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;ll often see people with post flairs mentioning 5Y, 2WK, or other dates, along with seemingly random emojis. These are actually indicating a person&#39;s transition status! While it&#39;s not mandatory to include this information, many users like to have this information as their post flair. We&#39;ll go over a few of the most common ones:</p>
<p>🍳🥚: Both are eggs, meant to represent ovaries. This is often used to represent Hysterectomy.</p>
<p>🐘: The elephant&#39;s head is said to bear a resemblance to the entirety of the female set of reproductive organs. This is also sometimes used to represent Hysterectomy. </p>
<p>💉: Syringe is the most common emoji used to represent Testosterone, given that it is often administered via needle and syringe. </p>
<p>⚕️: The medical symbol can sometimes be used to indicate general medical transition.</p>
<p>🔪: The Kithcen Knife emoji is often used to refer to top surgery, as it&#39;s the closest emoji we have to a scalpel. </p>
<p>✂️: Scissors are sometimes used to refer to top surgery, as a reference to a common intrusive thought that dysphoria can sometimes cause, about using scissors as a DIY top surgery. (We do not recommend this!)</p>
<p>🍆: If you&#39;ve ever sent a salacious text, you probably know what this emoji represents! It&#39;s often used for bottom surgery.</p>
<p>🦴: A less common emoji, but the phallic shape of a bone gets the point across that this is used for bottom surgery.</p>
<p>🍌: Like the previous emojis, the phallic shape of a banana is also occasionally used to represent bottom surgery. </p>
<p><strong>Other common emojis that aren&#39;t indicative of transition status may include:</strong></p>
<p>🏳️‍🌈: Rainbow Pride flag, Often used to celebrate pride and indicate a queer sexuality.</p>

# Identity
## Am I Trans?

***
***What does &quot;trans&quot; mean?***

*Trans is an umbrella term for individuals whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex they were assigned at birth. We use the term to include a wide range of identities including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, agender, and two-spirit.

For a guide to related terms, see [Glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_glossary).

***
***I’m questioning my gender. How do I know if I’m trans?***

One of the most repeated pieces of advice is, “Only you can really know.” 

But what if you don’t know? The best way to understand your feelings on gender and decide whether you want to transition is to examine your feelings from day to day. Keep a journal about how you feel about your gender, and talk to someone whom you trust. Talking to a therapist who is experienced in gender issues can be very helpful. If possible, experiment with your presentation—try dressing more masculine, binding, getting a haircut, and see how you feel. Give yourself plenty of time to figure this all out. 

***
***When I was a child I didn’t do typical boy things or call myself a boy. Could I still be trans?***
    
Yes. Many men, both cis and trans, were not overtly boyish as children. Some trans men claimed themselves to be boys when they were children, but many did not. We are informed by our parents and by society what is expected of us—to be girls—and it can be very difficult to start questioning that message.

***
***I don’t feel that much discomfort with living life as a female. Could I still be trans?***
    
Yes. Some trans men live happily as female for many years before realizing they want to transition. 

If you’re questioning whether or not you are trans, it helps to sit down and think deeply about why you’re questioning this. Maybe you’ve never been too uncomfortable living as a female, but when you start exploring, you find that you’d much rather live as a male. Reflecting on your feelings about gender is a great way to work through this question. You might find that you identify more with another identity under the trans umbrella such as genderqueer, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming, which is great too.

***
***I have little to no gender dysphoria. Could I still be trans?***
    
Yes. Not everyone's is the same. Some people have very little of gender dysphoria or even no gender dysphoria. Some people will tell you that people with no gender dysphoria are not trans. Ignore those people. The definition of &quot;transgender&quot; is someone's whose gender identity is different than the one assigned to them at birth, not whether or not someone has gender dysphoria.

However, if you’re seeking medical treatment that requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, you should be aware of the diagnosis criteria for gender dysphoria. [The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \(DSM-V\)](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) provides the diagnosis criteria for Gender Dysphoria in the United States. The criteria is different for adolescents and adults than it is for children.

Another resources to be aware of if you are seeking medical assistance in regards to transitioning or with assistance in regards to gender questioning is the [World Profession Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).](https://www.wpath.org/about/mission-and-vision) WPATH provides the [standards of care](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc) which many medical institutions (including insurance companies) use in creating guidelines on providing medical treatment to transgender, transsexual, and gender nonconforming individuals. It provides in-depth guidelines on, not only treating gender dysphoria but also treating transgender, transsexual, and gender nonconforming individuals with respect, flexibility, and care. These guidelines can be used to advocate for yourself, and if necessary, educate your care providers.

***
***How can I “test” whether I want to transition?***
    
There are many non-permanent changes you can make to get a feel for presenting as male. While you’re doing these things, ask yourself how you like it and how it makes you feel.

* Try wearing masculine clothing. Go to a store and try on some pants and shirts that you like. (We’re lucky in that most people won’t bat an eye if a person they perceive as female is wearing traditionally masculine clothing.) If you want to, you can bring a friend. If you don’t want to go out in public, you might be able to try on a family member’s clothes or use an online retailer that allows you to try before buying or that allows simple returns. 

* Ask a trusted friend or family member to start referring to you with a male name and pronouns.  

* Consider presenting yourself as male online if you aren’t able to confide in somebody in real life.

* Try binding under your clothing and see how it feels. See [Binding](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_binding).

* Try getting a more masculine haircut. Be sure to specifically ask the hairdresser for a masculine style cut, and not a pixie cut.

* See [Passing and Presentation](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_passing_and_presentation) for more on masculine presentation.

## How We Knew: Stories
***
Understanding your gender identity can be a difficult process, especially since there's no official method to figuring that out. To help those who are questioning their gender, we have compiled our stories of how we came to know that we were trans and wanted to transition. Stories are tagged by common themes.

## Picking a Name
***
***How do I go about choosing a name?***

Thanks to /u/intenselotad for providing these resources.

**Making a Name List**

The first step to picking out your new name is getting together a list of possibilities. A common first place would be to ask your parents what they would've named you, had you been AMAB. You can also talk to friends about names they think would fit you. However, when it really comes down to it, your name is very personal, and it needs to feel right to *you.* So, here are some websites you can use to find a name.

* [Nymblr](http://www.nymbler.com/): Nymblr is a simple website that allows you to input &quot;inspiration&quot; names and get names similar to them as an output. You can then favorite names or block them from future searches.
* [Name Finder](http://www.babynamewizard.com/baby-name/advanced-name-finder): This site allows you to set parameters for names, including first letters, last letters, popularity, nationality, and lots of other things. It's especially helpful if you have some sense of what you're looking for, but still want ideas.
* [Namipedia](http://www.babynamewizard.com/baby-name): Input a name; receive the meaning, popularity, origin, and more.
* [Name Finder 2](http://www.babycenter.com/baby-names): Another name finder, sorts by gender and origin.
* [Name Genie](http://www.babynamegenie.com/baby-name-generator/): Input your last name &amp; gender and the genie will randomly generate a name. 
* [Names by Year](http://www.babycenter.com/babyNameYears.htm): Find the most popular names from the year you were born.
* [Baby Name Search](https://www.parents.com/baby-names/): Allows multiple search options.
* [Quick Name Generator](http://www.seventhsanctum.com/generate.php?Genname=quickname): Generates random full names. 
* [20,000 Names](http://www.20000-names.com/): What it says - lots of names organized into many categories. Thanks, /u/TurtleTape!
* [Behind the Name](http://www.behindthename.com/): A site with tons of resources, including name meanings and the capability to make lists. Thanks, /u/2hoeaway!
* [Namespedia](http://www.babynamespedia.com/): Names organized by category with meanings and related names. Thanks, /u/davros_mueller!
* [U.S. Social Security Administration's Popular Baby Names Page](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/index.html): Has options to list popular names by year, decade, by state or U.S. territory, as well as view changes in popularity of names by year or by searching a specific name.

In terms of organizing all these new-found names, my #1 recommendation would be a Google spreadsheet. List out names, origins, meanings, rankings, and anything else you find relevant. Then you can add friends and family to the spreadsheet and get their comments.

**Picking Out A Name**

Once you have a list, you need to work on narrowing it down. This involves getting feedback from others as well as seeing what names fit you personally. If you go with the spreadsheet option mentioned above, getting written feedback shouldn't be too hard. 

Think about what the names mean to you. Do you associate the name with anyone else? Does its meaning resonate with you? Do a quick search for the name to make sure it doesn't have a really negative connotation in popular culture (like Joffrey, or something). 

The last step before choosing a name is testing it out to see if it fits. Ask close friends to refer to you with a specific name. One of my favorite options is playing an RPG with your character using the name you want to test. Try talking to yourself in the mirror and introducing yourself with a chosen name. How does it feel? There is no exact moment when a name becomes &quot;right,&quot; you just have to try until you figure it out.

I hope this is able to help someone out there, and if anyone has anything to add, please let me know!

# Passing and Presentation
***
“Passing” is usually used on /r/ftm to describe a person's ability to be perceived by others as a male. For those who want advice on their presentation for the purpose of passing or looking more masculine, we have assembled these resources and answers to common questions. For more in-depth advice, see [T-Vox FTM Passing Tips](http://www.t-vox.org/index.php?title=FTM_passing_tips), [FTM Passing Tips by Andy and others](http://www.ftmpassingtips.com/passing.html), and [Gabriel's FTM guide](http://ftmguide.rassaku.net/). 

***
***Do I pass as male in these photos/videos/recordings?***

It’s difficult to judge from a limited scope of photos from a certain angle. While we can certainly give you some advice on whether you pass or how to pass better, you’ll get a better idea by going out in the real world. Go out in public and have interactions with strangers. If you can find a building where the men’s and women’s bathrooms are not side-by-side, go and ask somebody, “Where’s the bathroom?” and see what they say. If you have a webcam, chat websites like [Omegle](http://www.omegle.com/) are a place to find out how your gender looks to strangers.

***
***Is it possible to pass without taking testosterone?***

It is certainly possible to pass without taking testosterone. Some people who are not on T even live ‘stealth’ as males in their professional and social lives. Your particular face, voice, and body may make it easier or more difficult to pass without T. But you can work on passing by modifying your presentation and mannerisms, exercising, and even training your voice. The rest of this section contains advice on how to do this.

***
***How can I change my clothing to pass better?***

Dressing to pass is a unique challenge for every person, depending on body shape and style preferences. A universal piece of advice is to wear only male clothing. Within that wide range of options, some male clothing tends to work much better than others if you want to pass. You will likely need to go through some trial and error to find what works for you, but the following is our general advice.

**Top**: Usually, the main concern when it comes to the top half of the body is hiding the breasts. This can be done by compressing them (binding), wearing clothing to distract from them, or a combination of both. Layering can disguise the curves of the chest. Try an open zippered hoody over a T-shirt (rather than just the T-shirt). You also want your clothing to not cling to you, because that can highlight the curves. Cling can be reduced by laundering clothes with starch, wearing woven rather than knit fabrics, and wearing looser sizes. Don’t go too baggy, though, because you can end up looking like a kid in their parent’s clothes and sometimes baggy clothes can accentuate curves instead of hiding them. Eye-catching patterns like stripes can distract the eye from the chest. Black is a good colour to hide the chest as well. If you’d like to do your own research on this, a good place to start is to find out how women with large breasts reduce the appearance of theirs.

Another common concern is creating the look of a masculine frame. Men’s bodies tend to have broad shoulders and muscular arms, creating a top-heavy silhouette like an upside-down triangle. This makes it important to wear shirts that [fit in the shoulders](http://i.imgur.com/pt00uUI.jpg), even if it's just a t-shirt. Shirts that are not too long and are fitted in the torso, or at least not incredibly loose, also help (although this may be difficult to pull off if you’re also trying to hide your chest.) If you’re wearing a suit or blazer, a slight shoulder pad can help emphasize your shoulders. 

**Bottom**: Usually, the primary concern when it comes to pants is hiding the hips. Unless you are very muscular, you will probably not pass in women’s pants. Baggy pants tend to emphasize large hips and make the wearer look short and wide. A tapered leg usually works best to minimize the appearance of hips. Pant legs that are too long will either bunch up at the bottom, or you’ll fold them up, both of which look sloppy. If at all possible, tailor your pants to the correct length. If you’re on the small side, try boys’ sizes. Wearing youthful styles may help you pass as a young man or boy if your voice and face are not masculine enough to be seen as a grown man.

***My body is rather short and/or small. How can I dress my best?***

Being short and/or small-framed can be a barrier to passing as male, and especially to passing as your own age. And this is not only a trans guy problem. Take a look around--many cis men, even celebrities, are below average height. In fact, that's why it's called &quot;average&quot;—half of all men are below that height! There are numerous fashion and clothing resources available for short and small-bodied men:

***How can I change my hair to pass better?***

[Have a look at some styles](http://www.hairfinder.com/menshair.htm) and think about what might work with your face. It will likely take some trial and error to find a style you like, that also helps you look masculine.

Styles that usually work well if you're trying to pass:

* Sideburns cut [straight across](http://i.imgur.com/sZUr6ny.jpg) rather than [tapered](http://imgur.com/uTVE1xb)

* Hair with a bit of height at the top, to even out a round face

* A short back and sides (#3 clipper or shorter) haircut is traditionally masculine
 
The following styles are not recommended as they tend to be read as feminine, especially on a soft face:

* Unnatural color dyed hair

* Shaved or partially shaved head

* All hair buzzed to the same length, especially with straight hair

* Center-parted hair

* Long hair, especially if it’s straight. It is possible to pass with long hair, but generally very difficult. Even cis men with long hair get mistaken for women.

If you get a short haircut, be sure the hair cutter knows you are going for a masculine style.  If they think you are a female, there is a chance they’ll end up cutting it in a feminine style no matter what they say. You may want to be clear and say that you're trying to get a haircut that will help you to pass as male. If you prefer not to disclose, you can tell them you’re an actor playing a male in a play, so you need a male haircut.

***
***How can I change my mannerisms to pass better?***

Mannerisms—the way a person moves, gestures, and interacts with other people—play a significant role in whether a person is perceived as male or female. Sit in a coffee shop window or on a park bench and watch the way men and women move. There is certainly a difference, though not a universal one. If you’re interested, think about what specific mannerisms tend to be common in men or in women that you see. Keep in mind that there can be tremendous variation in different areas of the world, different cultures, and different social settings. For example, a man walking up to the ring for a boxing match does not walk the same as a man waiting in line at the post office. 

If you want to examine how your mannerisms compare to other men around you, here are some guiding questions. 

* How do men walk? Do they seem to lead with their shoulders, or with their hips? Look at the stance of the shoulders and elbows, and the placement of the feet. Check out this [walking demo applet.](http://www.biomotionlab.ca/Demos/BMLwalker.html) How do men sit down? Do they keep their legs close together, or open? 

* How do men greet other men? Do they shake hands, or nod slightly? Is it the same when greeting women?

* How do men convey emotion? When do they smile, laugh, or raise the tone of their voice?

* Are there mannerisms that tend to read as gay or straight? Young or old? Serious or relaxed?

Your mannerisms are something you might have never given a second thought to in the past, and they can feel like a part of you. You are under no obligation to modify your mannerisms as part of your transition. But if you’re interested, for the purpose of passing or looking more masculine, give it a shot. 


## Voice
***
***Is it possible to lower my voice without testosterone?***

Yes, it’s possible. In order to make your voice sound more masculine while pre-T, you need to learn how to talk more from your chest, rather than your throat. Long-term practice speaking low can increase your lower range to some degree. Results may vary.

***What can I do with diet &amp; exercise to look more masculine?***

Being perceived as masculine has a lot to do with your body, especially muscle in your arms and shoulders. Targeted diet and exercise can certainly help you look more masculine. If you want to lose fat, be aware that there is no way to target fat loss to a specific area (hips, chest).

# Pumping

***
***What can pumping do to me?***

Pumping is the practice of using a manual or motorized pump to create a partial vacuum around the penis, engorging it as blood is drawn in. Some trans men are interested in pumping for these potential benefits:

* Temporary increase in size, for use in sex

* Increased sensitivity

* Permanent increase in size after a long-term pumping regimen

There have yet to be any research studies that examine the long-term effectiveness of pumping in trans men. However, plenty of /r/ftm community members have shared [anecdotal experiences with pumping.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/search?q=pumping+OR+pump&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

***
***What are the reproductive consequences of taking testosterone?***

Long-term use of testosterone usually shuts down the body’s natural reproductive axis. The ovaries stop producing estrogen and stop releasing eggs, halting menstruation. However, this is not guaranteed, and there have been trans men who became pregnant by accident while on testosterone ([1](http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=7926533)). It is dangerous to continue a pregnancy while on testosterone because the fetus is exposed to the hormone.

If you stop taking testosterone, the reproductive system can begin to function again within several months ([source](http://www.nickgorton.org/Medical%20Therapy%20and%20HM%20for%20Transgender%20Men_2005.pdf), p. 58). It is possible to stop taking testosterone for some time to have a pregnancy, and then resume testosterone. This is not a guaranteed option, though, because testosterone may cause permanent sterility ([source](http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/care_program_and_services/hospital_services/Documents/hormones-FTM.pdf), p. 10). 

***
***What are the reproductive consequences of a hysterectomy?***

A hysterectomy, the removal of the uterus, means you will no longer be able to carry a pregnancy. Some people get a hysterectomy plus oophorectomy, the removal of the ovaries. In this case, you will no longer be able to have biological children. If you keep your ovaries, biological children are still possible by the process of oocyte harvest or banking. [More](http://www.nickgorton.org/Medical%20Therapy%20and%20HM%20for%20Transgender%20Men_2005.pdf) at p. 59.

# Finance
***

***How much is my transition going to cost?***

The cost of transition varies with your location and what specific steps you want to take in your transition. For more information on transition where you live, see [Country-Specific Resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_country-specific_resources). For an idea of ongoing transition expenses, see this example by [Gender Outlaw](http://genderoutlaw.wordpress.com/transition-expenses/).

**Presentation**
Acquiring a wardrobe of male clothing can be expensive, especially if your proportions are uncommon and you need things tailored. Shopping at local thrift stores can reduce this expense. This is especially wise if you are pre-T and are planning to gain a lot of muscle through working out. Don’t spend a lot of money on clothes that won’t fit you in the near future. 

Some people have had success buying clothing from eBay, [AliExpress](http://www.aliexpress.com/activities/mens_fashion/index.html), [Yesstyle](http://www.yesstyle.com/en/home.html), and other online retailers. Just make sure you have enough sizing information, because no matter how good the deal, it needs to fit you.

***
**Hormone therapy**

For a rough summary of the monthly cost of testosterone, see our chart in [Testosterone](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_testosterone). For as long as you are on testosterone, you will need regular blood work and visits to your prescribing doctor (usually every 6 months). Your private insurance or publicly funded healthcare may cover some of these expenses.

You may require additional health care and drugs to treat unwanted effects from testosterone such as acne and hair loss. Some people recommend taking vitamin supplements. Speak to your doctor about what supplements can do for you.

* USA: If you use a local pharmacy, check [GoodRx.com](http://goodrx.com) for a coupon that may save you significant money on your testosterone prescription. 

* Canada: Doctor's visits and bloodwork ordered by your doctor are covered by public health insurance. Your drug cost may also be covered, see [Canada](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_canada).

* UK: If you are with NHS, they cover the drug cost but residents of England must pay prescription charges. Another way to have your testosterone and bloodwork funded is to enter a Shared Care agreement with a private doctor. See [United Kingdom](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_united_kingdom).

***
**Surgery**
Costs vary by surgeon and procedure. For information on publicly funded surgeries in certain countries, see [Country-Specific Resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_country-specific_resources). 

When calculating the cost of your surgery, be sure to consider peripheral expenses such as travel, medical supplies, time off work, scar treatment, and health care to address postoperative complications that may arise.

* Top surgery: Usually $5-10,000 USD.

* Hysterectomy: $10-20,000 USD.

* Bottom surgery: Highly dependent on procedure(s) and number of stages. Simple metoidioplasty without testicular implants is ~$5000 USD; testicular implants add another couple thousand. Metoidioplasty with urethroplasty and testicular implants is ~$20-30,000+ USD.  Multi-stage phalloplasty with urethroplasty, testicular implants, and erectile implant is ~$75-150,000 USD.

***
**Legal changes**
If you wish to change your legal name and gender, the process may involve fees. In some places, a gender change requires a letter from your doctor or surgeon, which you may be charged for. You may be required to pay to publish a notice of your name change in a local newspaper. Also, once you have the legal change you will want to update all your identification documents (e.g. passport) and these may require additional fees to update. If you’re planning to change both name and gender, you can save money by waiting to do both at the same time, so you only pay for one replacement passport. For info on legal costs where you live, see [Country-Specific Resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_country-specific_resources).

***
***What are some ways I can save more of my income to finance my transition?***

The first step is to create a budget outlining all your income and spending. By reducing how much you spend, you can put aside more money for transition each month. /r/personalfinance has an FAQ on [Budgeting](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting) and the sub is an excellent resource for personal finance advice.

When you pay medical expenses out of pocket, you may be able to claim these expenses on your tax return. This may include peripheral costs such as travel to medical appointments. Do some research or ask a tax expert about medical deductions in your taxation region.

***
***What are some ways I can make extra income to finance my transition?***

If you can't take on a regular full-time or part-time job for some reason, there are still ways to supplement your income. /r/beermoney is a community about online money-making opportunities. Don't expect to make a living from this, only some extra cash. /u/mightybite recommends [Usertesting](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/29nz8l/get_paid_1015_dollars_for_515_minutes_of_your/) for the high payouts for your time.

Some people run e-commerce stores on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), [Storenvy](http://www.storenvy.com/), or similar sites as supplemental income.

# Travel
***
***Can I travel by plane with my binder, packer, or unchanged identity documents?***

If you have identity documents where the names or gender markers don't match up, this may give you trouble during travel. Have your doctor write a &quot;carry letter&quot; explaining that your IDs don't match because you are in the process of a gender transition. This can help to make travel smoother.

**USA:** Threads about Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checks: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1lnkrv/traveling_for_the_first_time_since_transitioning/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1ffpdk/tsatit_swishing_authorities/)

You may wish to carry a [Disability Notification Card](http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/notification-card) to discretely inform TSA agents of your trans status during screening.

# Detransition
***
***What if I decide that transitioning is not for me?***

Check out this [article in The Stranger](https://www.thestranger.com/features/2017/06/28/25252342/the-detransitioners-they-were-transgender-until-they-werent) detailing *some* individuals' experiences with detransitioning.

If you decide that transitioning is not the right step for you, then it is important to speak to a therapist. You have many options, including a choice between detransition, retransition, or continuing transition.  If you have not had an oophorectomy, you may want to stop taking testosterone as soon as possible in order to halt the changes caused by T.  


***How can I know if detransition is the right choice for me?***

Speak with your therapist. If you don’t have access to a therapist, look to your local LGBT center for resources. Try to question why you’re thinking of detransitioning. Is it because the changes are happening too fast? Talk about receiving a lower dose. Is it because of the social implications? Talk to a therapist about anxiety issues and treatment. Is it because you don’t want to appear as male? Question why you wanted to transition in the first place. There is nothing wrong with questioning yourself, or with finding that other identities than male fit you.

Remember: If you stop taking testosterone and/or other steps to transition, but later decide that you want to take those steps again, the option will still be open. 

***
## Stability of Testosterone Effects

***Which changes from testosterone are reversible, and which are not?***

The authors of this FAQ are not medical professionals and the following is not medical advice. See our full [Medical Disclaimer](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_medical_disclaimer).

After you stop taking testosterone, some of the effects of the hormone will reverse, but they won’t necessarily reverse completely. Some reversals will be immediate, while others can take months or years.

| **Not Completely Reversible (in most cases)** | **Completely Reversible (in most cases)** |
|:--|:--|
| Voice: typically stays as it was when you stopped T | Menstruation (if you still have a uterus) |
| Facial and body hair: what is present continues to grow, but does not become thicker or more widespread.| Fat redistribution and muscle growth| 
| Hair loss| Acne |
| Genital growth | Sex drive |
| | Emotional changes |

# Prevalence of Trans People

***
***How many trans or FTM people are there?***

Trans people are incredibly diverse in their lifestyles, medical choices, and whether or not they are 'out'. Thus, it is difficult to find a good estimate of the number of trans people in a population. If you wanted to know how many people graduated from Harvard in 2015, you could get the record from the University. But for trans people, there is no official record.

Early researchers estimated the incidence of transsexualism by counting how many people were approved for reassignment surgery. These numbers exclude those who cannot access these surgeries, and those who do not want them. Other studies estimate the number of trans people by name and gender marker changes in government databases. Again, some trans people are not able to make these changes, and some do not choose to.

Survey studies approach the question differently, asking a person to self-identify as trans rather than using medical or legal criteria. 

The following table is a summary of some of the research concerning the incidence of trans people, or relative incidence of FTM and MTF spectrum people. Keep in mind that a study can only estimate, and that some methods produce more reliable estimates than others. *All* research on this question is subject to [sampling bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias).

# Glossary
***
* **AFAB, CAFAB, DFAB, FAAB:** These are abbreviations for Coercively Assigned Female At Birth, Designated Female At Birth, and Female-Assigned At Birth. These terms can be used in place of &quot;born a women&quot; to be more inclusive and validating of trans people. They emphasize that &quot;female&quot; is a designation assigned to an individual at birth, not an inherent quality of the individual.

* **Binary:** In the context of transness, Binary refers to a binary gender, meaning Male or Female. This is the opposite of a nonbinary individual, whose gender lies outside the gender binary and is neither male nor female.

* **Binding:** The process of applying a specific garment or tape (Trans Tape or Kinesiology Tape, never bandages!) to an AFAB individual's chest to give the appearance of a flat chest. 

* **Bottom Surgery:** Referring to gender-affirming genital surgery to either create a phallus, remove birth genitals, or in the case of trans women, create a vagina. For trans men/mascs, there are two surgery techniques to create a phallus: Metoidioplasty and Phalloplasty.

* **Cisgender:** This term describes individuals whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth. 

* **Deadnaming:** The act of referring to a trans person as their birth name when they no longer go by that name.

* **Detransition:** When a person, trans or otherwise, has undergone some form of medical or social transition, and later has to stop or reverse the transition. This is often due to safety concerns, lack of access to medical care, repression, or on occasion, genuine regret. 

* **Dysphoria:** Often described as a profound state of unease, dissatisfaction, or distress. When these feelings are associated with gender, either social or physical, it is called gender dysphoria. It can present in many different forms and levels, including, but not limited to: Dissociation, depersonalization, depression, irritability, anxiety, and repulsion. Gender dysphoria is listed as a condition in the DSM-5, and to obtain medical treatment for transition you may be required to meet their diagnostic criteria. See [DSM-5 Gender Dysphoria Fact Sheet](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf).

* **Erectile Device:** A device used to assist in erections post-phalloplasty. External devices are often sleeves or rings that allow rigidity to the phallus and can be removed. Internal devices are surgically implanted and require some manipulation. The two main types of implant are the Semi-Rigid Rod, which allows for a permanent rigidity that is malleable enough to adjust to a more neutral position (Think of how a pipe-cleaner is stiff enough to maintain shape, but can be bent upwards or downwards.) or the Inflatable Pump, which allows for assisted erections by manipulation of a pump within one of the testicles that pumps saline into a rod in the penis to allow it to inflate much like a natural erection would. You can find more information at [Phallo.net](https://www.phallo.net/how-penile-implants-work.htm)

* **Euphoria:** Seen as the opposite to Dysphoria, this can relate to feelings of joy, comfort, contentedness, pride, or a simple feeling of something being correct. This is often experienced when a trans person's gender is affirmed, through social or physical transition and being treated like their true gender.  

* **FTM:** Female to Male or Female to Masculine.

* **FTN:** Female to Nonbinary or Female to Null

* **Gender identity:** This term refers to a person's own experience of their gender. A person may feel internally that they are male or female, masculine or feminine, something between the two, or something else.

* **Genderqueer:** A person who feels that their gender identity is not wholly male nor wholly female may identify as genderqueer. This broad term can include identities between male and female, identities comprising of multiple genders (e.g. bigender), identities without gender (agender, neutrois), and those with a gender identity that fluctuates (genderfluid). A person who is genderqueer may or may not choose to undertake hormone therapy or surgery as part of their transition. 

* **Gender-Nonconforming:** Also known as GNC. This is when someone dresses, acts, or otherwise presents in a way that is different from their gender. This can include things like a man painting his nails, wearing makeup, having traditionally feminine body language, or doing things typically associated with women and femininity. Women can also be gender-nonconforming and dress, act, or present in male or masculine ways. In their case, their presentation does not match up with their gender, but it does not make them any less for presenting as such. Nor is it always an indication of someone's transness. Some terms used to describe someone who is gender-nonconforming include: Tomboy, Butch, Stud (Primarily used in the black lesbian community), Femboy, Tomgirl, Sissy (Primarily used in NSFW settings), or Effeminate. 

* **Genderfluid:** A gender that does not stay at a constant identity and can fluxuate between multiple genders, such as male, female, nonbinary, or agender.

* **Hormone Blockers:** Also referred to as Puberty Blockers, this is a form of gender-affirming medical care which allows young trans people to prevent the potentially negative outcomes of going through a puberty that does not match their gender.

* **Hormone Therapy:** Also known as HRT (or TRT for trans men/mascs), this is the medical treatment many trans people undergo to masculinize or feminize the body. To read more about the effects of Masculinizing HRT, see [The Cleveland Clinic's guide to TRT](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22322-masculinizing-hormone-therapy)

* **Intersex:** Refers to someone born with an intersex condition. This is an umbrella term for many different umbrella terms, and can mean anything from mixed sex characteristics to atypical chromosonal makeup, and more. To learn more, see  [InterAct's guide to intersex conditions](https://interactadvocates.org/intersex-definitions/)

* **Metoidioplasty:** Often shortened to &quot;Meta&quot;. This is a bottom surgery procedure in which the ligaments tethering the T-Dick are cut to release the erectile tissue and provide more length. With this method, spontaneous erections are achievable, but the size and placement may be detrimental to some. See R/Metoidioplasty for more info.

* **Misgender:** The act of referring to someone with incorrect pronouns. Can include calling someone who uses he/him  &quot;She&quot;, using derogatory pronouns such as &quot;It&quot; to refer to a trans person, or using &quot;They/Them&quot; to refer to a person who does not use the pronouns They/Them (Also known as &quot;De-Gendering&quot;)

* **Nonbinary:** Also known as Non-Binary, NB*, or Enby. This includes anyone whose gender does not fit within the gender binary. 
 *NB is also used within black communities to denote &quot;Non-Black&quot; 

* **Passing:** On /r/ftm, this term usually refers to a person's ability to be perceived by others as a male. Passing is not necessarily the goal of transition, but if you personally want to be perceived as a male or as more masculine, see [Passing and Presentation](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/wiki/index#wiki_passing_and_presentation) for advice.

* **Phalloplasty:** A surgical procedure to create a phallus by use of graft skin from a donor site (Most common places are ALT: Thigh, or RFF: Forearm) to create a phallus. For more information, check out r/phalloplasty or r/everything_phallo 

* **Questioning:** A person who is questioning is someone who has yet to discover their gender and is in the process of figuring it out.


* **Scrotoplasty:** A medical procedure in which a scrotal sac is created, often using the labia majora.


* **Stealth:** When a trans person is able to fully pass as their gender and live their life without telling anyone they are trans. To all who see them, they are indistinguishable from a cis person. A stealth person may omit or change details about their past or medical history to maintain their stealth position. This is not the same as deceiving people, or &quot;Stealthing&quot; which is the act of telling a sexual partner you are wearing a condom when you are not. 

* **Testicular Implants:** After a scrotoplasty, testicular implant can be inserted into the scrotum to achieve a natural looking scrotum. The implants are filled with saline. 

* **TERF:** Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist. These are transphobic individuals who often have the incorrect opinion that trans women are &quot;Men in dresses&quot; and predators, while trans men are &quot;Confused victimized girls&quot; and brainwashed/traumatized/escaping misogyny. They are often vitrolic and dismissive of the trans experience and not tolerated on this subreddit.  

* **Trans:** This is a broad term for individuals whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex they were assigned at birth. We use the term to include a wide range of identities including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, agender, and two-spirit.

* **Transgender:** This term describes individuals whose gender expression and/or gender identity differs from conventional expectations based on the physical sex they were born into. This is sometimes used as an umbrella term that includes genderqueer and nonbinary people, crossdressers, drag queens, drag queens.

* **Transition:** The process of physical, social, and legal changes that a person takes in order to align their life with their gender identity. Transition *can* include hormone therapy, surgery, changes in physical presentation, adopting a different name and pronouns, and legal name and gender change. These steps are undertaken by personal choice; they are not required, other steps could be taken, and they are not necessarily done in any order.

* **Transmasc:** Originally a nonbinary specific term to describe a direction of transition that avoided binary gender language, it has now expanded and has been adopted by some trans men. This is a perscriptive identity, not a descriptive identity, as some trans men feel uncomfortable with the term and its gender-neutral nature.

* **Transphobia:** Bigotry against trans people. Transphobia that intersects with misandry is called &quot;Transandrophobia&quot;, while transphobia that intersects with misogyny is called &quot;Transmisogyny&quot;. The term Transmisogyny is most often used in reference to trans women, though trans men can also experience an intersection of transphobia and misogyny as AFABs. 
 
* **Transsexual:** This term is usually used to refer to individuals whose gender identity does not match the sex that was assigned to them at birth, and seek hormonal and/or surgical treatment in order to bring their body into alignment with their gender identity.

* **Transsex:** This term is a more modernized version of the term &quot;Transsexual&quot; and is often used by those who wish to reclaim the term and feel that it more accurately represents their experiences.

* **Truscum/Tucute:** Terms originated due to tumblr discourse in the 2010's. The terms were created by cis people pretending to be trans, but were later adopted by trans people. Truscum ideology revolves around gatekeeping dysphoria and can sometimes lead to denial of nonbinary people. Tucute ideology revolves around unquestioning acceptance of everything, including harmful terms such as &quot;Transracial&quot; &quot;Transabled&quot; and &quot;Transhuman&quot;.  Most trans people do not fall into either group and it is not recommended to seek out or join either, as the two communities are prone to toxicity and internalized transphobia. **Both of these terms and discussion of them are banned on the subreddit to avoid unnecessary drama**

#User Flair guide

**What do all these user flairs mean?**

You'll often see people with post flairs mentioning 5Y, 2WK, or other dates, along with seemingly random emojis. These are actually indicating a person's transition status! While it's not mandatory to include this information, many users like to have this information as their post flair. We'll go over a few of the most common ones:

🍳🥚: Both are eggs, meant to represent ovaries. This is often used to represent Hysterectomy.

🐘: The elephant's head is said to bear a resemblance to the entirety of the female set of reproductive organs. This is also sometimes used to represent Hysterectomy. 

💉: Syringe is the most common emoji used to represent Testosterone, given that it is often administered via needle and syringe. 

⚕️: The medical symbol can sometimes be used to indicate general medical transition.

🔪: The Kithcen Knife emoji is often used to refer to top surgery, as it's the closest emoji we have to a scalpel. 

✂️: Scissors are sometimes used to refer to top surgery, as a reference to a common intrusive thought that dysphoria can sometimes cause, about using scissors as a DIY top surgery. (We do not recommend this!)

🍆: If you've ever sent a salacious text, you probably know what this emoji represents! It's often used for bottom surgery.

🦴: A less common emoji, but the phallic shape of a bone gets the point across that this is used for bottom surgery.

🍌: Like the previous emojis, the phallic shape of a banana is also occasionally used to represent bottom surgery. 


**Other common emojis that aren't indicative of transition status may include:**


🏳️‍🌈: Rainbow Pride flag, Often used to celebrate pride and indicate a queer sexuality.

🏳️‍⚧️:Trans Pride flag, For those who want to rep some trans pride!

⚧️: Transgender symbol.

👨‍❤️‍👨: Two men with a heart, for mlm.

👬: Two men holding hands, for mlm.

🫄🫃: Pregnant men/transmasc.

🐻: Bear (A large, hairy gay man)
