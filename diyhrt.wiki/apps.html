a completely free, no strings attached way to get coupons for prescription drugs. (Only available to people
residing in America.) <a href="https://costplusdrugs.com/medications/" target="_blank">Cost Plus Drugs</a> is also a good USA source

</p>
<h5>QueerDoc • <a href="https://queerdoc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">queerdoc.com</a></h5>
<p>
QueerDoc is a new informed consent service that operates through an online telehealth model. It's only
available
in AK, CA, FL, ID, WA, UT, HI, MT and WY, but they are one of the cheaper options. Starting on a sliding scale
from
$175 intake and $125 for every 3 month followup appointment. Queerdoc also offers services to adolescents
with
parental consent. They also offer things like raloxifene for transfems/AMAB nbs that wish to pursue regimens
that limit or prevent breast development. Will also help you navigate referrals to surgery.
</p>
<h5>Plume • <a href="https://getplume.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getplume.co</a></h5>
<p>
Plume offers a legitimate path to HRT through virtual long distance healthcare if you can afford $99 a month
and
live in the United States. They are dedicated solely to transcare and the service is available in most
states.
The cost does not include the cost of prescriptions. Also offers a once-payment surgery referral letter
service.
</p>
<h5>TrueUClinic • <a href="https://trueuclinic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trueuclinic.com</a>
</h5>
<p>
The TrueUClinic offers a similar service. It's available in several states in the USA. Cost for the first
intake
appointment is $200, followup visits (every 3-6 months) is $150. Costs of prescriptions not included.
</p>
<h5>Folx • <a href="https://www.folxhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">folxhealth.com</a>
</h5>
<p>
Folx is another online HRT option similar to the above. It's available in 12 US states. For the first year,
the
cost is $120 a month, afterwards is $60/month. The medication will be shipped to your home.<br>

</p>
<h5>GenderGP • <a href="https://www.gendergp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.gendergp.com</a>
</h5>
<p>
GenderGP is a virtual clinic service that serves people internationally, but is very popular in the UK.
Costs
are variable (see image for their specified prices). The process to access HRT through GenderGP is somewhat
more
complicated than other virtual clinic services. They have been known to prescribe and keep people on very
low
doses.
