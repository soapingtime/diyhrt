about <del>wild fantasies we have about catgirls</del> what we’re actively learning on any given day. Thoughts may be incomplete and scattered, these are merely our own notes. Look at <a href="topics.html">Topics</a> and <a href="guide.html">Guide</a> for more structured info.</p> <h2 id="silicone-stoppers-are-cancelled"> <a href="journal.html#silicone-stoppers-are-cancelled" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="silicone-stoppers-are-cancelled"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Silicone Stoppers are Cancelled </h2> <p>These seemed like a good idea due to their high heat resistance and therefore their ability to withstand dry heat depyrogenation. However, we located a study that has indicated that benzyl alcohol (BA), the essential preservative in HRT, can be absorbed by silicone and then even evaporate out the other side of it. While this hasn’t been studied in relationship to a preparation with a 1% concentration of BA, it stands to reason that as the preparation make contact with the vial stopper it could, rather quickly, remove the preservative from the vial.</p> <p>This is of much higher concern than a stopper that did not undergo depyrogenation. we are switching the guide back to using butyl rubber. We will use a minimum of autoclaving the stoppers for a sterilization cycle. We will look further into using pressurized WFI at home to depyrogenate. This is probably out of reach or asking too much of the average homebrewer. we’re sad to have lost this easy method but grateful no vials have been produced with the silicone stoppers.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.marcorubber.com/o-ring-chemical-compatibility-chart.htm#chemId=268">BB + Silicone are a bad match</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.marcorubber.com/o-ring-chemical-compatibility-chart.htm#chemId=267">BA + Silicone are a good match</a></li> <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2016.11.021">BA evaporates through silicone barriers</a></li> <li><a href="https://recipesfaqs.com/does-mct-oil-break-down-silicone/">Silicone absorbs MCT oil</a> (no sources cited)</li> </ul> <h2 id="vial-contamination"> <a href="journal.html#vial-contamination" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="vial-contamination"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Vial contamination </h2> <p>why do a severe lack of sterilization practices in most DIY guides result in vials that are not causing infection en masse? our theory is that the benzyl alcohol in the vials is killing stray contamination. There are some studies that tangentially support that theory.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524851/">Contamination ID’d in multidose vials</a> - vet hospitals. found in 18% of MDVs</li> <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC272247/">Contam studied in vials</a> - 1982, no actionable info</li> <li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2173497/">contamination of multidose vials in simulated use</a> - 1990, regarding syringe reuse.

If the product is &lt;1 mL, the entire volume must be tested. If 1–40 mL, then half the total volume is tested. If 40–100 mL, then 20 mL is tested. If the volume is &gt;100 mL, then 10% of the volume is tested (but at least 20 mL).</p> </blockquote> <p>To do this you would decide how much of your preparation you’re testing, then you run it all through a 0.45μm filter. Then you can disassemble the filter, and put the membrane on agar. Incubate for 14 days.</p> <p>After the mixture passes through the 0.45μm filter it is, in theory, still adequate for use as soon as the tests clear. Therefore, you could do a procedure like filter most though a 0.22μm filter straight into vials. Filter the remainder through the 0.22μm into a sterile and depyrogenated container. Then run that all through the sterile 0.45μm filter (clean syringe) while dispensing into vials.</p> <p>This is not part of our procedure right now, but it should be. The issue we run into is regarding which type of agar to use for this. CSP pg 262 says that USP says that it needs to be FTM (lol) or SCDM agar, neither of which appear to be readily available for the public to purchase or to even make at home for less than hundreds of dollars – https://microbiologie-clinique.com/trypticase-soy-agar-principle-interpretation.html</p> <p>#TODO - finish section on sterility testing, revise the rest of the guide to reflect.</p> <p><em>1 week later</em></p> <p>Okay so scratch some of the above. This seemed more difficult to manage because the USP uses a weird naming convention for their agar types. What they call SCDM (soybean-casein digest agar medium) is typically referred to as TSA (tryptic soy agar) within the scientific community. TSA powder and plates are both readily available on Amazon for just shy of $50.</p> <p>It would be good to do more research on the second type of recommended agar, FTM, to see what the primary difference is between TSA and what types of growth it supports. Using one of these is better than none.</p> <p>Additionally, need to look into what type of agar is needed for fingertip testing.</p> <h2 id="what-does-heating-a-sealed-vial-to-120c-actually-do"> <a href="journal.html#what-does-heating-a-sealed-vial-to-120c-actually-do" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-does-heating-a-sealed-vial-to-120c-actually-do"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What does heating a sealed vial to 120C actually do?? </h2> <p>We can confidently say that the air inside the vial is heated to 120C also. When air is heated that much it should expand a relevant amount.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-pressure-will-be-produced-if-I-store-air-inside-a-container-with-a-volume-of-3-liters-and-heat-it-up-to-200-C">this Quora answer</a> we can use the Ideal Gas Law to calculate the pressure changes.</p> <p>103.4kPa x 393/293 = 138.7kPa</p> <p>assuming we start at 15psi and 20C, and we heat to 120C, we end up with a final pressure of 20psi inside the vial.</p> <p>Let’s crosscheck that pressure value with moist heat sanitization.</p> <p>moist heat sterilization requires a pressure of 15psi. Not sure how to rectify that with 15psi being like, literally what is in our living room rn according to the internet. Maybe the moral of the story is that we need steam. No one says to sterilize with pressurized dry heat.</p> <h2 id="benzyl-benzoate-bb"> <a href="journal.html#benzyl-benzoate-bb" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="benzyl-benzoate-bb"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Benzyl Benzoate (BB) </h2> <p><em>May 29, 2023</em></p> <p>There are reports of this ingredient not being needed as it’s primary purpose is to act as a solvent. Hormone esters are oil soluble, and so they will likely reach solution without it and with using a little heat. Unfortunately this could lead to preparations falling out of solution with dramatic environment changes, just a theory.</p> <p>Looking further, it appears that every recipe we can find online both from DIYers and pharmaceutical companies list benzyl benzoate as an ingredient.

Logically we think it just means you need to have air flowing OUT of the clean room, not in. This could be achieved as simply as having your air filter get intake from outside the room and push the clean air into the room.

We need to learn how to calculate the Sterility Assurance Level (SAL).</p> <p>Filtration is important. Unless filtration is terminal filtration it cannot be assumed to create a sterile end product. <strong>(What makes it terminal?)</strong> An explanation of features needed in the syringe filter are listed in this chapter. Filters must be tested for integrity after they are used and results recorded. See CSP pg 252 for diagram.</p> <p>Biological indicators must be used when sterilizing by heat to help ensure that the sterilization cycle was effective.</p> <p>There is also info here about using steam and dry heat. Dry heat sterilizer using a static-air sterilizer (basically an oven) is not suitable for most materials. Use 338F for 60 mins, 320F for 120 mins, or 302F for 150 mins. We imagine if using a kitchen oven there should be a thermometer inside to verify temperatures.</p> <p>Steam sterilization (autoclave) is considered terminal sterilization, it can be used to to sterilize the product and final container.It is the preferred method to sterilize aqueous solutions and suspensions that have been verified to maintain their chemical and physical stability under the required conditions. <strong>How can we verify this with EEn or TEn?</strong></p> <p>There is a formula that will let you determine temperature/time/pressure ratios.</p> <p>D = decimal reduction time (minutes). time to reduce microbial population by 90% T = temperature Z = number of degrees of temp required to change D-value one log unit in time by a factor of 10. If D at 121C is 2 minutes, and the z-value is 10C, then D at 131C is 0.2 minutes. We get what this means but not really how to find the needed values. F<sub>0</sub> = idk?? it says this is a value but doesn’t actually define it.</p> <p>100 microbes in a solution, reduced by 1D, 10 microbes left.</p> <p>Always document autoclave details per batch. Temp, pressure, chamber config, num articles sterilized.</p> <p>A dry sealed container will not be sterilized by steam, a small amount of water must be within the container to sterilize interior. Most oils and powders can’t be sterilized by steam as it may adversely affect the material.</p> <p>Need to be able to verify the sterilization process was successful. How?</p> <p>Use biological indicators containing <em>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</em> (USP Chapter 1035) to help determine that sterilization is successful.

We have spent several months researching how to make DIY Estradiol Enanthate injectable vials, and we’re coming to the conclusion that there is no definitively <em>good</em> resource on how to do this. There is, however, a lot of information floating around. Most full-blown guides are lacking a full explanation of why they’re doing what they’re doing, and additionally fail to hold themselves to what we consider adequate sterilization standards.</p> <p>we are of the mind that if you are making vials for just yourself, and you make an informed decision to skip some sterilization procedures, then that is your right. However, it seems like most people who are making DIY vials do not have access to the right information for them to be making informed decisions around this. Worse then, when people use incomplete guides online to make HRT to distribute.</p> <p>So, it is our goal to document our learning and brewing process in order to create a new standard for DIY guides. We will always be open to researched and referenced criticisms with the ultimate goal of creating the best open source guide we possibly can.</p> <p>More to come.</p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
